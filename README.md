# Clean Architecture Project SetUp

This is just a setup project which follows the Clean Architecture pattern, designed to achieve separation of concerns, maintainability, and flexibility in software development.

## Structure

The application is organized into five distinct layers:

1. **Domain:**
   - Defines core business logic, entities, and value objects.
   - Encapsulates business rules and use case definitions.

2. **Application:**
   - Orchestrates interactions between the Domain and Infrastructure layers.
   - Implements use cases and business logic.
   - Contains application services that manage use case execution.

3. **Infrastructure:**
   - Handles external concerns such as databases, APIs, and frameworks.
   - Implements interfaces defined in the Domain and Application layers.
   - Provides data storage, API clients, and framework integrations.

4. **Presentation:**
   - Deals with user interfaces and input handling.
   - Contains controllers or presenters that interact with use cases.
   - Converts Domain objects to UI-friendly formats using mappers or adapters.

5. **Web API:**
   - Exposes endpoints for external clients to interact with the application.
   - Defines routes/controllers, authentication, and data serialization.

## Benefits

- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of layers makes maintenance and updates easier.
- **Flexibility:** Components can be replaced or updated independently.
- **Testability:** Isolated layers facilitate comprehensive and efficient unit testing.
- **Scalability:** Individual layers can be optimized for performance.
- **Reduced Coupling:** Dependencies are minimized, leading to better codebase stability.
- **Future-Proofing:** Core logic remains unaffected by changes in external technologies.
- **Collaboration:** Common vocabulary and structure enhance team communication.
- **Long-Term Viability:** Supports evolution and adaptation over time.
- **Onboarding:** New team members can grasp the architecture more quickly.
- **Technical Debt Reduction:** Clean structure avoids accumulating technical debt.
